<img width="275" height="183" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/036203a0-58e1-449c-a203-e7c068713674" />



## üìå Introduction  

In today‚Äôs digital economy, financial institutions generate vast amounts of transactional data daily. For a bank like **Bank of America**, understanding this data is critical to improving operational efficiency, strengthening customer relationships, and staying competitive in a rapidly evolving financial landscape.  

This project leverages transactional records to provide a **comprehensive analysis of customers, agents, and merchants**. The dataset contains details on transaction value, channels used, commissions, customer demographics, and merchant activity ‚Äî enabling a holistic view of how the bank‚Äôs ecosystem operates.  

The primary motivation behind this analysis was to answer key business questions, such as:  
- Who are the top-performing agents, merchants, and customers?  
- What channels do customers and merchants prefer for transactions?  
- How do transaction values and volumes trend over time?  
- Which customer segments contribute the most to overall performance?  
- How can commissions, agent performance, and merchant activities be optimized?  

By building an **interactive Power BI dashboard**, this project transforms raw data into actionable insights. The dashboard not only highlights high-value customers and merchants but also uncovers hidden trends in agent performance, seasonal transaction patterns, and customer behavior.  

Ultimately, this work provides decision-makers with the tools to:  
- Identify and reward top performers.  
- Optimize transaction channels and commission strategies.  
- Strengthen customer engagement and retention.  
- Develop data-driven strategies for growth and profitability.  

This introduction sets the stage for exploring the detailed **visualizations, insights, and recommendations** presented in the following sections.  
  

## üóÇ Dataset  
The dataset contains transaction records with attributes such as:  
- **Transaction Details** (value, volume, type, channel, location)  
- **Customer Information** (age category, location)  
- **Agent Information** (commission, performance, activity)  
- **Merchant Information** (location, transaction activity, channels used)  
- **Calendar** (date hierarchy for time-based analysis)  

The **Transactions table** serves as the fact table, linked to dimension tables for customers, agents, merchants, and calendar.  

## üéØ Objectives  
1. Analyze customer behavior and engagement across years.  
2. Track agent activity, commissions, and performance.  
3. Measure merchant activity and identify top contributors.  
4. Discover seasonal and channel-based transaction patterns.  
5. Provide executives with a clear, actionable visualization dashboard.


  ## üèó Data Modelling

To ensure efficient analysis and reporting, a **relational star-schema model** was designed in Power BI. This model connects **transactions**, **customers**, **agents**, **merchants**, and a **calendar table**, creating a unified structure for business intelligence.  

### üìä Model Overview  

The schema consists of:  

1. **Fact Table**  
   - **Transactions** (`opay_transactions_medium`)  
     - Holds all transaction records including amount, channel, customer, agent, merchant, and transaction status.  
     - Measures such as **Total Amount**, **Transaction Count**, and **Failure Rate** are derived here.  

2. **Dimension Tables**  
   - **Customers** (`opay_customers_medium`)  
     - Attributes: Customer ID, Name, Location, Age, Age Category, Customer Type, Registration details.  
     - Enables segmentation of transaction activity by demographics.  

   - **Agents** (`opay_agents_medium`)  
     - Attributes: Agent ID, Name, Location, Join Date, Commission Rate, Status.  
     - Supports analysis of agent performance and commission trends.  

   - **Merchants** (`opay_merchants_medium`)  
     - Attributes: Merchant ID, Name, Category, Location.  
     - Provides insights into merchant performance and activity.  

   - **Calendar** (`Calendar`)  
     - Attributes: Date, Month, Quarter, Year.  
     - Serves as the time intelligence backbone for trend analysis.  

### üîó Relationships  

- **Transactions ‚Üî Customers**: Linked by `customer_id`.  
- **Transactions ‚Üî Agents**: Linked by `agent_id`.  
- **Transactions ‚Üî Merchants**: Linked by `merchant_id`.  
- **Transactions ‚Üî Calendar**: Linked by `Transaction Date`.  
- **Agents ‚Üî Calendar**: Linked via `join_date` for tenure and performance analysis.  

This structure follows a **star schema**, placing the **Transactions table** at the center as the fact table, with Customers, Agents, Merchants, and Calendar serving as dimensions.  

### ‚úÖ Benefits of This Model  

- Ensures **scalability** and efficient queries.  
- Enables **time-series analysis** using the Calendar table.  
- Allows for **segmentation** by customer, agent, and merchant.  
- Provides a strong foundation for **KPI measurement** and **dashboard visualization** in Power BI.
